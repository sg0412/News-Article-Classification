      "Singers including Sir Cliff Richard and Boy George are recording a charity single to help raise funds for victims of the Asian tsunami.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They hope the song will raise more than Â£2m for the relief fund. The song, titled Grief Never Grows Old and described as a melancholy ballad, was written by radio DJ Mike Read. Former Boyzone singer Ronan Keating may also take part if a studio can be found close to where he is holidaying in Switzerland. Other music stars being approached include Robin and Barry Gibb of The Bee Gees, jazz sensation Jamie Cullum, Chris Rea and Olivia Newton-John.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Cliff has recorded his vocal part in Barbados, while Boy George has recorded his in New York. Read wrote the song before the Boxing Day tragedy but had thought it was too gloomy to release. Now he plans to have it recorded by a collection of pop stars under the name One World Project. \"It's a natural home for it because people kept saying to me, 'it's such a good song', but it's such a sad song,\" Read said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He said the song was a slow ballad and would work with around 10 singers, rather than a \"sing-along\" like the Band Aid 20 single raising money for famine relief in Africa. The backing track has already been recorded and organisers hope it can be finished within the next week to get it into record shops as soon as possible. Read went to the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC), which is co-ordinating the British relief effort, with the idea the day after Boxing Day. \"I was totally shocked at the enormity and suddenness of the disaster and in tears on seeing the orphaned children wandering aimlessly in search of their parents,\" he said. Read said all the funds raised by the record would go to the DEC. \"I'd only be pleased in terms of what it meant for sales if it got to number one,\" he added. The charity welcomed the news of the single and said money raised would help its agencies working in the affected region to rebuild survivors' lives and livelihoods.\n",

      "Jolanda Ceplak has urged Britain's Kelly Holmes to continue competing at the major championships.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Double Olympic gold medallist Holmes has strongly hinted she will not run in this year's Worlds and is undecided about next month's European Indoors. But World Indoor 800m record holder Ceplak said: \"There is never an easy race when she is in the field. There is only excitement at what might happen. \"It is good for the sport. She always fetches the best out of everyone.\" Ceplak has been a great rival of Holmes' during the Briton's career and the pair fell out when Holmes questioned the manner of the Slovenian's runaway 800m victory at the 2002 European Championships. But the controversy has since been forgotten, with Ceplak acting as pacemaker for Holmes' failed attempt on the British Indoor 1500m record at the Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham in 2003.\r\n",

She was like my idol from the beginning of my career.\" Meanwhile, Ceplak will be looking to follow up last Saturday's win in Boston with a fast time and victory in Friday's Night of Athletics in Erfurt, Germany. Britain's Jason Gardener had been expected to defend his 60m title in Erfurt but instead he will save himself for a competition in Leipzig on Sunday. Gardener's decision means Scotland's 400m man Ian Mackie will carry British hopes in what looks sure to be a tough preparation for next weekend's Norwich Union European trials in Sheffield.\n",

      "South Korea's largest credit card firm has averted liquidation following a one trillion won ($960m; Â£499m) bail-out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "LG Card had been threatened with collapse because of its huge debts but the firm's creditors and its former parent have stepped in to rescue it. A consortium of creditors and LG Group, a family owned conglomerate, have each put up $480m to stabilise the firm. LG Card has seven million customers and its collapse would have sent shockwaves through the country's economy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The firm's creditors - which own 99% of LG Card - have been trying to agree a deal to secure its future for several weeks. They took control of the company in January when it avoided bankruptcy only through a $4.5bn bail-out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They had threatened to delist the company, a move which would have triggered massive debt redemptions and forced the company into bankruptcy, unless agreement was reached on its future funding. \"LG Card will not need any more financial aid after this,\" Laah Chong-gyu, executive director of Korea Development Bank - one of the firm's creditors - said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The agreement will see some 12 trillion won of debt converted into equity. \"The purpose of the capital injection is to avoid delisting and the goal will be met,\" David Kim, an analyst at Sejong Securities, told Reuters. South Korea's consumer credit market has been slowly recovering from a crisis in 2002 when a credit bubble burst and millions of consumers fell behind on their debt repayments. LG Card returned to profit in September but needed further capital to avoid being thrown off the market. South Korea's stock exchange can delist any firm if its debt exceeds its assets two years running.\n",

      "Support for a ban on hunting has fallen in the past six years, a poll suggests.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Less than half the UK wants a ban compared to almost two-thirds in 1999, the Mori survey of 2,000 adults for BBC One's Countryfile programme suggests. The number opposed to a ban remains constant, but those \"neither supporting nor opposing\" has increased by 11%. Most city-dwellers support the ban but rural people were evenly split between supporters, opponents and undecided.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Polling company Mori carried out both surveys. In July 1999 they asked 801 adults if they supported the ban for the Mail on Sunday. For Countryfile they asked 2,234 adults across the country the same question. The Mail on Sunday survey found that 63% supported a hunting ban compared with 24% against. In the Countryfile survey, 47% said they supported the legislation, with 26% against. But the programme makers suggest the British public are becoming \"increasingly neutral\" to the issue because around one quarter said they \"neither support nor oppose\" a ban.\n",

Details of how many anti-social behaviour orders (Asbos) were used in the last year are also being published. Labour sees nuisance behaviour as a key election issue but critics claim the record is at best patchy. A year ago, ministers launched their anti-social behaviour plan and Thursday's figures offer a progress check. They will say that in the past year more than 2,600 anti-social behaviour orders were issued by the courts - more than double the total used in the previous four years.\r\n",

But researchers from Leeds University warned that CSOs could undermine traditional bonds between police officers and communities. More work needed to be done on clarifying the role of different agencies and how they linked together before CSOs, they argued in a the study. Critics of the government say it has announced more than 20 initiatives to tackle nuisance behaviour when the real focus should be on good policing. Home Office Minister Hazel Blears also revealed this week that \"about a third\" of Asbos were breached - with some people jailed and others not.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Jason Robinson has led the team during their opening three defeats in the Six Nations tournament, in the absence of fly-half Jonny Wilkinson. The world champions have struggled since the retirement of former captain Martin Johnson, a lock forward. And former England captain Moore told the BBC: \"Full-backs are too far away from the action. That's not a reflection on Robinson personally.\" He added: \"I just think the point of influence needs to move closer to the pack - which is, after all, where games usually start and finish.\" Moore says a lack of cohesion in the forwards is one of the reasons why England have lost against Wales, France and Ireland in this year's tournament. \"Assertiveness in the pack isn't there, we're not getting enough people into the breakdowns,\" he explained. \"Wer'e not getting quick ball, which means the backs are being stifled. Their creativity depends on quick ball and we're not getting that.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With injuries depriving him of key players like Wilkinson, coach Andy Robinson has given youngsters such as Harry Ellis and Jamie Noon a chance. And Moore believes the last two games against Italy and Scotland are a good opportunity to experiment further. \"The problem is the players that are around to replace the icons which have been lost because of retirement and injury don't have the requisite experience,\" Moore added. \"You can't do anything about that but play them. There are players who have been knocking on the door, it's time for them to be looked at in these last two games because there's nothing on them. \"We then go into next season with a greater certainty of who can and cannot handle the pressure of international rugby.\"\n"

      "\r\n",
      "A blind student has developed software that turns colours into musical notes so that he can read weather maps.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Victor Wong, a graduate student from Hong Kong studying at Cornell University in New York State, had to read coloured maps of the upper atmosphere as part of his research. To study \"space weather\" Mr Wong needed to explore minute fluctuations in order to create mathematical models. A number of solutions were tried, including having a colleague describe the maps and attempting to print them in Braille. Mr Wong eventually hit upon the idea of translating individual colours into music, and enlisted the help of a computer graphics specialist and another student to do the programming work.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The images have three dimensions and I had to find a way of reading them myself,\" Mr Wong told the BBC News website. \"For the sake of my own study - and for the sake of blind scientists generally - I felt it would be good to develop software that could help us to read colour images.\" He tried a prototype version of the software to explore a photograph of a parrot. In order to have an exact reference to the screen, a pen and tablet device is used. The software then assigns one of 88 piano notes to individually coloured pixels - ranging from blue at the lower end of this scale to red at the upper end. Mr Wong says the application is still very much in its infancy and is only useful for reading images that have been created digitally. \"If I took a random picture and scanned it and then used my software to recognise it, it wouldn't work that well.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr Wong has been blind from the age of seven and he thinks that having a \"colour memory\" makes the software more useful than it would be to a scientist who had never had any vision. \"As the notes increase in pitch I know the colour's getting redder and redder, and in my mind's eye a patch of red appears.\" The colour to music software has not yet been made available commercially, and Mr Wong believes that several people would have to work together to make it viable. But he hopes that one day it can be developed to give blind people access to photographs and other images.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "China has been accused of blocking access to Google News by the media watchdog, Reporters Without Borders.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Paris-based pressure group said the English-language news site had been unavailable for the past 10 days. It said the aim was to force people to use a Chinese edition of the site which, according to the watchdog, does not include critical reports. Google told the BBC News website it was aware of the problems and was investigating the causes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "China is believed to extend greater censorship over the net than any other country in the world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A net police force monitors websites and e-mails, and controls on gateways connecting the country to the global internet are designed to prevent access to critical information. Popular Chinese portals such as Sina.com and Sohu.com maintain a close eye on content and delete politically sensitive comments. And all 110,000 net cafes in the country have to use software to control access to websites considered harmful or subversive.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"China is censoring Google News to force internet users to use the Chinese version of the site which has been purged of the most critical news reports,\" said the group in a statement. \"By agreeing to launch a news service that excludes publications disliked by the government, Google has let itself be used by Beijing,\" it said. For its part, the search giant said it was looking into the issue. \"It appears that many users in China are having difficulty accessing Google News sites in China and we are working to understand and resolve the issue,\" said a Google spokesperson. Google News gathers information from some 4,500 news sources. Headlines are selected for display entirely by a computer algorithm, with no human editorial intervention. It offers 15 editions of the service, including one tailored for China and one for Hong Kong. Google launched a version in simplified Chinese in September. The site does not filter news results to remove politically sensitive information. But Google does not link to news sources which are inaccessible from within China as this would result in broken links.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Tessa Jowell, has hit out at critics of the Gambling Bill.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She told the Guardian newspaper there would be no \"Las Vegas-style\" super-casinos, as rumoured in the press. Meanwhile Labour backbencher Stephen Pound labelled casino-related regeneration schemes \"a pile of pants\". The MP for Ealing North claimed the legislation would encourage a mafia-like culture of vice and corruption, in an interview on BBC Radio 4. \"You look at some of the people who are involved...they aren't in there to regenerate Blackpool. They are in it to fill their boots,\" Mr Pound told the Today programme. \"I just really think that we have made a terrible mistake here. And over all of it hangs the shadow of the men in the chalk-stripe suits with names that rhyme with spaghetti,\" he said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ms Jowell complained of the \"scale of misrepresentation\" in the media over the bill in her interview with the newspaper, her first since the bill was launched. The culture secretary said a four year consultation period had produced a consensus on the need to \"protect children and the vulnerable\" in a swiftly changing sector. Ms Jowell insisted: \"We have a good track record for extracting planning gain in this country, for instance in social housing.\" And continued: \"We can be proud to have one of the lowest rates of problem gambling in the world. I intend to keep it that way.\" Ms Jowell will set out her position when the Bill is debated in the Commons on Monday. In prime minister's questions last week Tony Blair assured Parliament that 90% of the bill was about tightening up the regulation of the gambling industry.\n"

      "\r\n",
      "Up to 2,500 jobs are to go at US insurance broker Marsh & McLennan in a shake up following bigger-than-expected losses.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The insurer said the cuts were part of a cost-cutting drive, aimed at saving millions of dollars. Marsh posted a $676m (Â£352m) loss for the last three months of 2004, against a $375m (Â£195.3m) profit a year before. It blamed an $850m payout to settle a price-rigging lawsuit, brought by New York attorney general Elliot Spitzer. Under the settlement announced in January, Marsh took a pre-tax charge of $618m in the October-to-December quarter, on top of the $232m charge from the previous quarter. \"Clearly 2004 was the most difficult year in MMC's financial history,\" Marsh chief executive Michael Cherkasky said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "An ongoing restructuring drive at the group also led to a $337m hit in the fourth quarter, the world's biggest insurer said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Analysts expect its latest round of cuts to focus on its brokerage unit, which employs 40,000 staff. The latest layoffs will take the total number of jobs to go at the firm to 5,500 and are expected to lead to annual savings of more than $375m. As part of its efforts to cut costs, the company said it was halving its dividend payment to 17 cents a shares from 34 cents, a move which should enable it to save $360m. Looking ahead, Mr Cherkasky forecast profitable growth for the year ahead \"with an operating margin in the upper-teens, and with the opportunity for further margin expansion\". Meanwhile, the company also announced it would spin-off its MMC Capital private equity unit, which manages the $3bn Trident Funds operation, to a group of employees. Marsh did not say when the move would take place, but said it had signed a letter of intent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The insurer hit the headlines in October last year when it faced accusations of price rigging. New York Attorney General Elliot Spitzer sued the company, accusing it of receiving illegal payments to steer clients to selected firms as well as rigging bids and fixing prices. In January, Marsh agreed to pay $850m to settle the suit - a figure in line with the placement fees it collected in 2003 - and agreed to change its business practices. In February, a former senior executive pleaded guilty to criminal charges in a wide-ranging probe of fraud and bid-rigging in the insurance industry. In January, a former senior vice president also pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to the investigation. In an effort to reform its business practises, Marsh said it has already introduced new leadership, new compliance procedures and new ways of dealing with customers. \"As a result, we are ready to put these matters behind us and move ahead in 2005 to restore the trust our clients have placed in us and to rebuild shareholder value,\" Mr Cherkasky said.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The gap between US exports and imports has widened to more than $60bn (Â£31.7bn), an all-time record.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Figures from the Commerce Department for November showed exports down 2.3% to $95.6bn, while imports grew 1.3% to $155.8bn on rising consumer demand. Part of the expanding deficit came from high prices for oil imports. But the numbers suggested the sliding dollar - which makes exports less expensive - has had little impact, and could indicate slowing economic growth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The trade deficit - far bigger than the $54bn widely expected on Wall Street - prompted a rapid response from the currency markets.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By 1650 GMT, the dollar was trading against the euro at $1.3280, almost a cent and a half weaker than before the announcement. Against the pound, the dollar was down about 0.7% at $1,8923. \"The dollar's fall has been sudden, violent and appropriate given this number,\" said Brian Taylor of Wells Fargo in Minneapolis. \"Recent exchange rate movements certainly haven't had any impact yet.\" Treasury Secretary John Snow put a brave face on the news, saying it was a sign of strong economic expansion. \"The economy is growing at such a fast rate that it is generating lots of disposable income... some of which is used to buy goods from our trading partners.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Although the White House officially still backs the US's traditional \"strong dollar\" policy, it has tacitly indicated that it would be happy if the slide continued. The dollar has fallen by 50% against the euro - as well as by 30% against the yen - in the past three years. The main catalyst, most economists accept, is the large budget deficit on the one hand, and the current account deficit - the difference between the flow of money in and out of the US - on the other. The trade deficit is a large part of the latter. In November, the fall in exports was largely due to a decline in sales of industrial supplies and materials such as chemicals, as well as of cars, consumer goods and food. One small bright spot for US policy-makers was a slight decline in the deficit with China, often blamed for job losses and other economic woes. Although China's overall trade surplus is expanding, according to Chinese government figures, the Commerce Department revealed the US's deficit with China was $19.6bn in November, down from $19.7bn the month before. But the deficit with Japan was at its worst in more than four years.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The media giant, run by Rupert Murdoch, owns 82% of the shares in the company, home to the Fox television network and the 20th Century Fox film studio. The move follows News Corp's decision to register its business in the US. 20th Century Fox's recent film releases include I Heart Huckabees and I, Robot, while Fox puts out hit TV series 24.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Under the terms of the offer, minority Fox shareholders will receive 1.90 News Corp shares in return for each Fox share they hold. Analysts said the decision to list News Corp in the US - which will result in the firm's shares trading in New York rather than Sydney- nullified the need to retain a separate stock market listing for Fox Entertainment shares. News Corp investors voted in October to approve the transfer of the company's corporate domicile from Australia to the US state of Delaware. The move is designed to help News Corp attract more investment from the largest US financial institutions, and make it easier to raise capital. Fox Entertainment Group generated revenues of $12bn last year. News Corp shares fell 25 cents to $17.65 after the share offer was announced while Fox shares were up 19 cents at $31.22.\n"

      "In a statement issued on Thursday, Laura Ashley thanked Ms Mohd-Saaid for her services to the company. Its shares were down 8.51% to 10.75p in late Thursday morning trading on the London Stock Exchange.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Since 2002, Ms Tan has been managing director and chief executive of Metrojaya, one of the largest retail groups in Malaysia. Laura Ashley, which is due to issue its next trading statement in the next few weeks, has in recent months been hit by reports of poor sales. In October last year, it announced the closure of one of its two Welsh factories. In September, the company had said that its half-year clothing sales had been \"below expectations\". In recent times, it has put renewed focus on home furnishings rather than clothing, but last September it reported that interim six month losses had risen from Â£1m to Â£1.2m, while sales had fallen from Â£138m to Â£118m.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Laura Ashley, which floated on the London Stock Exchange for Â£200m ($376m) in 1995, is majority-owned by Malaysia entrepreneur Dr Khoo Kay Peng. In 1996, its share price was more than 200p. It has long been reported that Dr Khoo intends to take the company private, but he has always denied this. \"Laura Ashley is a bit of a shrivelled husk of a company,\" said retail analyst Nick Bubb of Evolution Securities. \"It is all pretty odd with its Malaysian owners seemingly just shuffling the deckchairs.\" Laura Ashley was founded by its late namesake in Kent in 1955, before moving to Mid Wales in 1961 where it still has its main UK factory.\n",

      "Bangkok film festival battles on\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Organisers of the third Bangkok International Film Festival have been determined to carry on with this year's event despite the ravages of the Asian tsunami disaster.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The festivities have been scaled down, red carpets have been mothballed and profits from ticket sales are being donated to the tsunami relief fund. Apart from this, however, the festival has continued as originally planned. \"When the disaster happened, we naturally asked ourselves if we should cancel,\" said the festival's executive director, Craig Prater. \"The decision was made that we would continue, but that the focus would change.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Our premieres became fundraisers, the opening night was visibly toned down and 10% of every ticket sold goes to the disaster fund,\" he continued. \"But we feel like we've turned a page. We've acknowledged our position, and now it's business as usual.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr Prater's sentiments were echoed by Christine Rush, director of the festival's sister event, the Bangkok Film Market. \"We have been careful to be respectful of the Thai nation's recovery from this terrible disaster,\" she said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"However, the nation's recovery very much depends upon it continuing its economic life. \"We are encouraging attendees to keep the victims in mind and aggressively support the aid organisations helping out,\" she added. Given the conspicuously low audience figures, that support may be more symbolic than significant. However, poor ticket sales have less to do with any fallout from the disaster and more to do with administrative and promotional difficulties.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The eclectic programme contains a wide range of titles, including such Oscar hopefuls as Ray Charles biopic Ray and Mike Leigh's abortion drama Vera Drake. That said, the absence of Thai subtitles on most film prints might have proved offputting to local cinemagoers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On a more positive note, the celebrity guests attending the event have generated huge media interest in this busy capital city. Problems securing air transport, the clash with last Sunday's Golden Globes ceremony in Los Angeles and other factors have forced some big names to cancel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the festival has still attracted such Hollywood directors as Oliver Stone and Joel Schumacher, alongside such screen stars as Michael Douglas, Jeremy Irons and Jean-Claude Van Damme. Irons, whose film Being Julia is in competition for the festival's Golden Kinnaree awards, said he had wondered whether he should attend after December's catastrophe. \"I questioned whether I should come when such a tragedy had happened,\" the British actor said. \"I thought it might be in rather bad taste. But then I spoke to the organisers and I was encouraged to let life go on. \"Now I've come here I'm very glad. What impresses me about Thai culture is they get over these things far quicker than we do in the West,\" he continued. \"Basically I was invited here by Thailand. If they still want you to come, you should.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now in its third year, Bangkok is a relatively recent addition to the hectic film festival calendar. And while it has yet to attain the stature of more established events held in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Pusan in South Korea, Mr Prater predicts it will soon become their equal. \"It's grown awfully fast in three years - maybe too fast,\" he concedes. \"We've had some bumps in the road, but that's only because the festival is still a baby. \"I have no doubt in my mind that in five years, this will be the top Asian film festival in the world.\" The Golden Kinnarees will be awarded on Friday. The festival itself runs until 24 January.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "UK airport operator BAA has reiterated its support for the government's aviation expansion plans to airports throughout the country.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The comments come a day ahead of a High Court challenge by residents' groups and local councils to the government's White Paper. The judicial review will centre on government plans for expansion at Heathrow, Stansted and Luton airports. BAA, which operates all three, said it was consulting with local communities. \"We are...consulting on voluntary compensation schemes which go beyond our statutory obligations,\" a BAA spokesman said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Groups challenging the plans include Stop Stansted Expansion, Heathrow anti-noise campaigners HACAN Clearskies and the London boroughs of Hillingdon and Wandsworth. At Heathrow, Gatwick, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, BAA launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in September 2004, which will close next week. The company is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked, unblighted price. Among other measures, BAA has set up a homeowner support scheme for people living near Stansted, and has launched a special scheme for those close to the airport but far enough away not to be covered by the homeowner scheme. At Heathrow, BAA said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental, air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At Gatwick, the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway. Stop Stansted Expansion said the White Paper, published in December 2003, was \"fundamentally flawed\" and did not follow the proper consultation process. \"We do not underestimate the scale of the challenge before us because the courts have never before overturned a government White Paper,\" said Stop Stansted Expansion chairman Peter Sanders said. HACAN chairman John Stewart said: \"Almost exactly a year ago the government published its 30-year aviation White Paper with much fanfare. \"It hoped that would be the end of the debate and it could proceed with its plans for a massive expansion of aviation. \"Yet, a year later the protesters are still here, and stronger than ever. \" A judgement from Mr Justice Sullivan is expected early in February.\n"

The move would see the Socialist Party (PSOE) lose power in the Junta, as the regional government is known, for the first time in 36 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Talks in Andalusia have been ongoing since regional polls were held on December 2. The PSOE, led by incumbent premier Susana Díaz, had been expected to win the early elections, but in a shock result the party took the most seats in parliament, 33, but fell well short of a majority of 55. It was their worst result in the region since Spain returned to democracy. The PP came in second, with 26 seats, while Ciudadanos were third with 21. The major surprise was the strong performance of far-right group Vox, which won more than 391,000 votes (10.9%), giving it 12 deputies. The anti-immigration group is the first of its kind to win seats in a Spanish parliament since the end of the Francisco Franco dictatorship. It now holds the key to power in Andalusia, given that its votes, added to those of the PP and Ciudadanos, constitute an absolute majority.\n",

The difficulties that Ciudadanos has faced to justify the necessary inclusion of Vox in the talks, has slowed down progress. Rather than align itself with the far right party, the group – which began life in Catalonia in response to the independence drive, but soon launched onto the national stage – had sought a deal with Adelante Andalucía.\n",

    "Wednesday was a day of intense talks among the parties in a bid to find a solution that would keep everyone happy. But at 9pm last night, Adelante Andalucía announced that it would not be part of “any deal” and that would instead vote for its own candidates to the speaker’s committee in order to “face up to the right wing and the extreme right.”\n",

    "Vodafone España has informed representatives of its employees that it is putting a collective dismissal plan into action that will affect a maximum of 1,200 workers, 24% of its total workforce in Spain of 5,000 people. The layoffs, news of which was broken by EL PAÍS in November, have been justified by the telecoms giant due to the obligation to reduce costs due to a fall in earnings caused by a continuous reduction of prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "“In the current market climate, demand for services continues to grow exponentially, but this is not the case with prices,” the company stated in a press release. “Nearly 50% of net new customers are associated with low- or medium-cost offers, something that obliges Vodafone to have a cost structure that is prepared to successfully compete in all segments.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Vodafone added that the current expectations of clients, “who demand an agile, simple and immediate relationship [with their operator],” is prompting the firm to seek “a more simplified organizational model that strengthens coordination and synergies between teams.”\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, the company continued, it is looking to “reverse the negative trend of the business, strengthen sustainability, protect our capacity to invest and design a more competitive organization that adapts better to what our customers are asking for.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The operator says that it is sure it can reach a deal with labor unions so that the measures are as painless as possible. The redundancies will likely take effect at the end of February or the beginning of March.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vodafone has suffered a great deal in the trade war that was sparked by its rivals Movistar and Orange, after the company opted not to buy the rights for Champions League or La Liga soccer matches on the basis of low returns. The strategy has prompted an exodus of clients from their broadband internet, mobile and pay-TV services.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first three quarters of 2018, Vodafone has lost 361,000 cellphone lines (70,000 of which were contracts), 134,000 broadband customers, and 108,000 pay-TV subscriptions. The operator has only seen positive numbers in fiber optic internet, where it has put on 84,000 customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The operator executed a similar collective dismissal plan (known in Spanish as an ERE) in 2015, reaching a deal with the main labor unions UGT and STC, and which meant the firing of 1,509 workers – 238 fewer than those initially proposed by the company. Vodafone justified those sackings based on the duplication of roles caused by the purchase of rival operator ONO in 2014, and the absorption of the company’s workforce.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the acquisition of ONO, Vodafone also executed an ERE in 2013. On that occasion, the company agreed with unions on the firing of 620 employees, the externalization of services, which affected 130 workers, and changes in the conditions of another 150 people.\n",

    "Elon Musk told the world in late 2017 that Tesla was taking its automotive know-how and applying it to a totally new challenge: self-driving big rigs. But one year later, he placed the Tesla Semi fourth on a list of priorities for the company, behind the upcoming Model Y compact SUV and an electric pickup truck. This week, Daimler executed a move many years in the making by announcing its own big rig (albeit diesel-powered) outfitted with semi-autonomous technology. And others are following suit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The German automaker also committed to manufacturing the truck this summer, with deliveries scheduled for later this year. It pledged 500 million euros over the next few years to the continued development of an autonomous big rig, and said it has hired hundreds of employees to move the tech forward. And just like it did when it unveiled the prototype version in 2015, Daimler gave us a ride in the truck to get a taste of what the near future of trucking will look like.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "While there are a few Tesla Semi prototypes on the road now, and a dozen or so big name companies have placed preorders for the trucks, it doesn’t look like a production version is coming any time soon. Tesla still hasn’t said where or exactly when it will build the trucks, and would likely need to raise more money (or sell a hell of a lot more Model 3s) to fund the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "DAIMLER FIRST SHOWED OFF A PROTOTYPE IN 2015\n",
    "This has left the door wide open for companies like Daimler, the parent company of Mercedes-Benz. Daimler announced it was working on its own self-driving big rig in 2015 when it showed off a working prototype called the Freightliner Inspiration Truck. The automaker went big, debuting the truck on the Hoover Dam and offering test rides at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. This week at the Consumer Electronics Show, Daimler returned to Las Vegas to make good on its promise with a production version of that prototype truck.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new Cascadia is not much more advanced than the prototype was in 2015. In fact, the technology is still pretty limited. Daimler says it’s the first Class 8 commercial truck with Level 2 autonomy (referring to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ scale for self-driving definitions), meaning the driver is in control, but is supported heavily by the truck’s technology in certain situations. In that sense, the new Cascadia essentially has the same basic driver assistance technology many modern cars offer, including automatic lane centering, adaptive cruise control, and emergency braking.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "The Freightliner Inspiration Truck at the event in 2015.\n",
    "But the new Cascadia is doing this with a limited set of sensors. There’s a forward-facing camera, a forward-facing radar, a second radar sensor on the right side of the truck. That package pales in comparison to the dozens of cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and radars you’d find powering Autopilot, let alone the Tesla Semi, which is supposed to have a beefed-up version of this same sensor suite.\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps keep costs down, but means the technology is more in line with what you’d find powering something like Nissan’s ProPilot driver assistance feature as opposed to Autopilot, or even Audi’s supposedly Level 3 system, which uses similar tech, but relies on LIDAR as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "DAIMLER’S TRUCK HAS MORE IN COMMON WITH NISSAN’S PROPILOT SYSTEM THAN TESLA’S AUTOPILOT\n",
    "Keeping with a theme of less is more, there’s also no camera-based monitoring system in the truck to make sure the driver pays attention while using the Level 2 features. Instead, the Cascadia uses a system similar to the one found in Tesla’s cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sensor in the steering column measures resistance applied to the steering wheel. If the driver takes their hands off the wheel while using the lane centering feature, the instrument cluster will, after about 15 seconds, surface a warning that tells them to place their hands back on the wheel. If the driver doesn’t do that, the warning changes from yellow to red. After another 60 seconds, if the driver still hasn’t put their hands back on the wheel, the truck will come to a stop on the side of the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    " \n",
    "The new Cascadia is a far cry from a fully autonomous truck, but based on my brief ride, Daimler has refined the technology compared to the prototype version. The prototype swayed on the highway during my two-mile demo ride in 2015, ping-ponging between the lane markers. The new truck, meanwhile, felt locked to the center of the lane during this week’s ride, which followed the same exact route from a few years ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Daimler representative also told me that, while lane centering is on, the driver can even choose where the system places them in the lane. (For example, if a driver is on a tight one-lane highway and wants to avoid clipping oncoming traffic, they could tell the truck to hug the right lane line.) This is another sign that system is maturing from what debuted in 2015, though it’s a small one.\n",
    "\n",
    "RELATED\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what it’s like to ride in Daimler’s self-driving semi truck\n",
    "Daimler promised some other modern technologies are coming the new Cascadia, though none of it was on display in the preproduction trucks being used for the demonstration. The company plans to offer an optional 10-inch touchscreen in the dashboard, and a 12-inch digital cluster behind the steering wheel. The truck will be able to receive over-the-air software updates, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cascadia won’t be as stuffed with tech as the Tesla Semi, nor is it as sleek. But it will be available later this year. Daimler has argued that bringing automation to trucking will help squeeze better fuel efficiency out of the millions of miles that its big rigs cover every year. It would decrease the toll those miles take on the drivers. Most importantly, it could help reduce the some 4,000 fatalities that result from crashes involving these massive hunks of machinery. If all goes well, we might have a sense by the end of this year of whether any of that is true.\n",

    "The obesity epidemic has been on the rise for years, with cases nearly tripling since 1975, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). And the outlook for the future is equally bleak – and that includes Spain, a country that is famed for the positive effects of its supposedly Mediterranean diet.\n",
    "\n",
    "An investigation by the Mar de Barcelona hospital has found that 80% of men and 55% of women will be overweight by 2030. If the current trend continues, the researchers write, within 11 years more than 27 million people in Spain will be overweight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being overweight can mean a higher risk of suffering a number of diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, stroke and cancer\n",
    "\n",
    "The study, published in the Spanish Cardiology Magazine, points out that this epidemic will mean costs of €3 billion for the country’s health system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue, the experts state, is not an esthetic one, but rather a question of health. Being overweight can mean a higher risk of suffering a number of diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, stroke, cancer and other cardiovascular conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers at the Barcelona hospital revised all of the scientific literature published in Spain on epidemiology and the prevalence of obesity and excess weight between 1987 and 2014 in order to come up with an accurate picture of the state of the country’s residents. “We found the trends and we cross-referenced them with data covering the general population from the National Statistics Institute in order to estimate the figures of obesity and excess weight,” explains Álvaro Hernáez, the chief researcher on the project. The results revealed an “alarming future.”\n",

    "\n",
    "“There are currently 25 million people with excess weight, three million more than a decade ago,” explains Dr Albert Goday, another author of the study. “In a conservative scenario, if this trend continues, there will be another three million more – 16% more cases – by 2030.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“In men, excess weight is more usual up to the age of 50,” explains Goday. “From 50 onward, obesity rises among women. These are issues that are intrinsically linked to hormonal metabolism. From a certain age, it is harder for women to control their weight.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The experts argue that any weight loss, no matter how small, reduces the risk of contracting one of the associated illnesses. “We aren’t going to find the key to this or a vaccination overnight,” Goday adds. “But any minor intervention will help to reduce the risk. You might think that you have made a huge effort and have only lost four kilos when you need to lose many more, but you must bear in mind that those four kilos are already reducing the risk.”\n",

The hunters will be entitled to pursue and kill thousands of foxes in the countryside,” states PACMA.\n",
